This dashboard shows:
✓ Count of all IPFS uploads
✓ File names and descriptions
✓ IPFS hashes (content addressing)
✓ File sizes
✓ Upload timestamps
✓ File types/MIME types
✓ Download functionality

To export the complete inventory:
1. Go to the storage page (link above)
2. Look for "Export", "Download", or similar button
3. Save as JSON or CSV format
4. Use for analytics, documentation, or integration

API Limitations:
The public thirdweb API endpoints don't expose file listing for storage.
Direct dashboard access is the most reliable method to view all files.
